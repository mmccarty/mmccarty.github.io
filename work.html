        <h3>What I Do</h3>

        <h4>Software</h4>
        <p>I work with organizations to write the software that is needed today while engineering it to be testable and maintainable tomorrow.</p>

        <h4>Data Engineering</h4>
        <p>I build systems to either get data to where it needs be for knowledge extraction or bring the compute power to the data.

        <h4>Problem Solving</h4>
        <p>I greatly enjoy applying my skill set to the problem domain in order to provide solutions that are essential to the daily lives of others.

        <h3>Projects and Highlights</h3>
        <h4>Anaconda</h4>
        <p>Core developer on <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/enterprise/">Anaconda Enterprise.</a></p>

        <h4>Zoomdata</h4>
        <p>I worked on a <a href="http://www.zoomdata.com">Big Data Business Intelligence tool</a>.

        <h4>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, TCPI</h4>
        <p>I led and developed the data ingest and analysis pipeline for <a href="https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/Transforming-Clinical-Practices/">TCPI</a>.

        <h4>National Institute for Computational Sciences at Oak Ridge National Lab</h4>
        <p>I worked in the High Performance Computing Operations group, which supported the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_(supercomputer)'>Kraken</a>. The Kraken was the NSF's first PetaFLOP system and was the most powerful computer in the world managed by academia at the time. Specifically, I built a framework for automated regression testing of the system (McCarty et. al. 2010 as referenced in my CV).

        <h4>National Radio Astronomy Observatory</h4>
        <p>I developed the <a href="https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/gbt/schedules/dynamic">GBT DSS</a>, worked on the <a href="https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/cdl/alma-support">ALMA Front End Test and Measurement System</a>, and discovered a <a href="assets/images/SPIGOT_Ter5_050505_PSR_1748-24ae.pfd.ps">pulsar</a>.

        <h4>Open Source Contributions</h4>
        <p>In the spirt of getting back to my roots, I have started contributing to <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy">AstroPy</a>. A community effort to develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster interoperability between Python astronomy packages.

        <p>I am also a member of <a href="https://www.numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>. NumFOCUS is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific computing.

        <p>In 2013, I was involved in reviving <a href="https://github.com/tpendragon/alacarte">Alacarte</a>. A content management system that was started in 2007 at the Oregon State University Libraries and Press.
