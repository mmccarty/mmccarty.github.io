              <p class="article-date">Posted on: 26 May 2021</p>
              <p>Last Friday was my last day at Capital One. I will miss all of the wonderful
people that I had the fortune of working with over the past few years. Next week I
will be joining the Product team at NVIDIA to focus on Python Developer tools.</p>

<p>One hobby that I picked up during my time a Capital One that I intend to keep is
<a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/custom-machine-learning-estimators-at-scale-on-dask-rapids-e2b9519a6d1f">writting</a>
<a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/dask-and-rapids-the-next-big-things-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-at-capital-one-d4bba136cc70">articles</a>.
Let’s start by taking a look back on a few things.</p>

<h3 id="dask">Dask</h3>

<p>When I joined Capital One over two and a half years ago, I was happy to find a
few Dask users had managed to deploy clusters on a few of the internal
infrastructure systems, however it wasn’t widely adopted. In fact, a few Python
model training pipelines were scaled vertically on larger cloud instances. These
pipelines would take days to run, but the developers wanted to stick with the
PyData stack. This was an opportunity for Dask, so I started a side project to
evangelize it at the company. I began advising teams and giving <a href="https://github.com/dask/dask-tutorial">Dask
tutorials</a> to education others on how the
library could help them scale their workflows. Eventually, I was managing a team
of Dask developers and my side project suddenly became one of my primary duties.
We built an internal community of hundreds of Dask users, contributed to the
public project, gave public and internal talks about our work, training hundreds
of data scientists, and even built our own libraries on top of Dask.</p>

<h3 id="rapids">RAPIDS</h3>

<p>A few months into my time at Capital One, the Center for Machine Learning formed
a partnership with the RAPIDS team at NVIDIA. Our goals were to be early
testers, provide feedback, talk about what we learned, and contribute. Again,
deployments were a huge challenge, however we managed to usher the suite of
conda packages and system level dependencies through the cloud governance
policies. Before long we were testing multi-node multi-GPU workflows and felt
the bounds of network limitations on the cloud. A nice place to be!
Additionally, we were on the front lines as beta users for the incorporation of
native Dask support and GPU acceleration into XGBoost. Lack of efficient GPU
development environments limited our code contributions to the project and
ability to support GPU computing in our internal libraries. My advice is to just
build a workstation and throw a GPU card in it, but even that can be a challenge
for a financial institution.</p>

<h3 id="rubicon">Rubicon</h3>

<p>I was originally hired to lead the
<a href="https://github.com/capitalone/rubicon-ml">Rubicon</a> team, although back then it
had a completely different architecture that was based on gRPC. We went through
a few major architectural overhaws and eventually landed on a simplified design
that could be open sourced without the need for custom services. At the same
time, we realized how making Rubicon a “serverless” library, built on top of
<a href="https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">fsspec</a>, could dramatically
reduce our operational burden. I look forward to seeing how the project evolves
and hope it grows in the PyData community.</p>

<h3 id="remote-work-during-a-pandemic">Remote Work During a Pandemic</h3>

<p>The last fifteen months of working remote during the pandemic have had its ups
and downs. For one, my home office has had a few major upgrades! I must say that
I am so proud of the team for seamlessly transitioning to being remote full time
last year. I have often stopped to think about how amazing it was to see so many
families pressing on as best as they can during the pandemic. Blurred lines
between home and work, and back-to-back Zoom calls all day, have left me feeling
burned out on a few occasions. Everyone, please remember to take breaks and go
for a quick walk a few times during the day. It is easy to sit at your desk for
way too long! This will be an ongoing challenge for me given that I’ll be remote
at NVIDIA.</p>

<h3 id="being-a-middle-aged-programmer">Being a Middle Aged Programmer</h3>

<p>Building enginneering teams is a lot of fun! Running them is not always as much
fun, but still pretty neat! As a Director at Capital One, I was constantly asked
if I was manager or individual contributor (IC). I would say, “both” or “it
depends on the day.” As time wore on, I would spend less time thinking about
code and more time thinking about people who wrote the code. And that was fine
as long as I remained close to the users. Over time, I felt more like a
technical product manager than an engineer. When I started talking to the
Product team at NVIDIA, it was a natural fit!</p>

<p>Being a Director of Software Engineering was all very interesting and I may do
it again someday, but I don’t think the path I was on is the only one for this
middle aged programmer. It seems to me that the path I’m about to walk–in the
traversal of the tree of life in this profession–should be explored given that
there will be even more middle aged programmers in the not to distant future.
Perhaps more on this later.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h3>

<p>I’m extremely excited to join NVIDIA and help drive the acceleration of the
Python/PyData ecosystem. The community is amazing and the work has been very
rewarding! I’ll be managing developer products rather than developers.
And perhaps some constructive mischief from time to time!</p>
