## Origin

I was raised in Kentucky by a two amazing parents along with three brothers
and two sisters. All of my siblings were older and many even had families of
their own, which meant that I was fortunate to have grown up in a large family,
and as the cool uncle.

My mother was a graduate from the University of Kentucky and taught children
with special-needs. Shortly after I arrived, she retired due to illness, however
she would often work as a substitute teacher, and, of course, care for me. My
father served in the US Army during the Vietnam War, where he learned to speak
Vietnamese. Later, while stationed in Alaska, he led one of the first rescue
teams into Valdez after the great earthquake in 1964. After the he left the
military, he worked tireless at a steal plant for 30 years to provide for the
family. He loved the outdoors and especially fishing.

## Academic and Early Career
I attended university at Morehead State University in the department of Math
and Physics where I received a dual degree in Computer Science and Physics.

My experiences at MSU led to a career as a Software Engineer at the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory. While at the NRAO, I worked on projects that
involved analysis of observational data in the radio spectrum, monitor and
control systems for the world's largest fully movable telescope, and an
automated system that factors in weather forecast to maximize science. I also
spent some time at the National Institute for Computational Sciences 
located at Oak Ridge National Lab. During my time at NICS, I worked in the High
Performance Computing Operations group which ran the National Science
Foundationâ€™s first petaflop supercomputing system (the Kraken).

In 2013 began working in the private industry focusing on web / mobile
application development, data analysis pipelines, large data business
intelligence applications, and open source / enterprise data science tools and
platforms.

## Recent Work

I recently worked at the Center for Machine Learning at [Capital
One](https://www.capitalone.com), where I built and led a team of engineers
building Machine Learning Tools for internal practioners. These tools leverage
open source software projects such as [Dask](www.dask.org),
[RAPIDS](www.rapids.ai), and [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/). We also
open sourced one of the tools, [Rubicon
ML](https://capitalone.github.io/rubicon-ml/).
