Hi, I'm Mike. I build software for folks in the scientific community and at
large enterprise companies. These days, I mostly focus on the Python data
science and machine learning ecosystem. When I can, I open source the software I
work on and sometimes I even help companies open source
[software](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/open-source/standardizing-machine-learning-model-development-with-rubicon/)
that was once consider propritary.
