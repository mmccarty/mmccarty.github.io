## What I Do

### Software
I work with organizations to write the software that is needed today while engineering it to be testable and maintainable tomorrow.

### Data Engineering
I build systems to either get data to where it needs be for knowledge extraction or bring the compute power to the data.

### Problem Solving
I greatly enjoy applying my skill set to the problem domain in order to provide solutions that are essential to the daily lives of others.

## Quick Biography

Since 2005, I have been providing custom solutions to an eclectic mix of spaces in private and public industries. I spent the first 7 years of my career in the field of scientific computing at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and National Institute for Computational Sciences (NICS) located at Oak Ridge National Lab. Most of this work was done in Python, Haskell, C, and C++. While at the NRAO, I worked on ranged from data analysis of astronphysical observations in the radio spectrum to advanced telescope scheduling systems that consider weather forecast to produce optimal science. This work was done with NumPy (Numeric or Numarray in those days), SciPy, Matplotlib, Haskell, and Django. During my time at NICS, I worked in the High Performance Computing Operations group which ran the National Science Foundation's first petaflop supercomputing system (the Kraken). Since 2013, I have been working in the private industry focusing on web / mobile application development, data ETL/analysis pipelines, and most recently Big Data Business Intellegence applications. This experience has given me a unique perspective on a varity of programming languages and techonology applications. I have watched the Python I grew up with  grow into the massive data science driven community with fasinating advances in open source software development, machine learning, algorithms, programming environments, conferences/meetups, cloud computing solutions, and more. It's a very exciting time to be a programmer.
