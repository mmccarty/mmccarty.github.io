#### Anaconda
Platform Engineer on [Anaconda Enterprise](https://www.anaconda.com/enterprise).

#### Zoomdata

#### Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, TCPI
I led and developed the data ingest and analysis pipeline for
[TCPI](https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/Transforming-Clinical-Practices)

#### National Institute for Computational Sciences at Oak Ridge National Lab
I worked in the High Performance Computing Operations group, which supported the
[Kraken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_(supercomputer)). The Kraken was
the NSF's first PetaFLOP system and was the most powerful computer in the world
managed by academia at the time. Specifically, I built a framework for automated
regression testing of the system (McCarty et. al. 2010 as referenced in my CV).

#### National Radio Astronomy Observatory
I developed the [GBT
DSS](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/gbt/schedules/dynamic), worked on the
[ALMA Front End Test and Measurement
System](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/cdl/alma-support), and discovered a
[pulsar](assets/images/SPIGOT_Ter5_050505_PSR_1748-24ae.pfd.ps).
