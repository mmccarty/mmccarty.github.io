          <p>Since 2005, I have been providing custom solutions to an eclectic mix of spaces in private and public industries. I spent the first 7 years of my career in the field of scientific computing at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and National Institute for Computational Sciences (NICS) located at Oak Ridge National Lab. Most of this work was done in Python, Haskell, C, and C++. While at the NRAO, I worked on projects that ranged from data analysis of astrophysical observations in the radio spectrum to advanced telescope scheduling systems that consider weather forecast to produce optimal science. This work was done with NumPy (Numeric or Numarray in those days), SciPy, Matplotlib, Haskell, and Django. During my time at NICS, I worked in the High Performance Computing Operations group which ran the National Science Foundation’s first petaflop supercomputing system (the Kraken). Since 2013, I have been working in the private industry focusing on web / mobile application development, data ETL / analysis pipelines, and most recently Big Data Business Intelligence applications. This experience has given me a unique perspective on a variety of programming languages and technology applications. I have watched the Python I grew up with grow into the massive data science driven community with fascinating advances in open source software development, machine learning, algorithms, programming environments, conferences/meetups, cloud computing solutions, and more. It’s a very exciting time to be a programmer.</p>
