          <p>Since 2005, I have been providing custom solutions to an eclectic mix of spaces in the private and public industry. 
            During the first 7 years of my career, my focus was in the field of scientific computing at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 
            (NRAO) and National Institute for Computational Sciences (NICS) located at Oak Ridge National Lab. Most of this work 
            was done in Python, Haskell, C, and C++. While at the NRAO, I worked on projects that involved data analysis of 
            astrophysical observations in the radio spectrum, monitor and control systems for the world's largest fully movable telescope, 
            advanced telescope scheduling systems that consider weather forecast to produce optimal science, and others. This work was primarily
            done with NumPy (Numeric or Numarray in those days), SciPy, Matplotlib, Haskell, 
            and Django. During my time at NICS, I worked in the High Performance Computing Operations group which ran the National 
            Science Foundation’s first petaflop supercomputing system (the Kraken).</p>
          <p>In 2013 began working in the private industry 
            focusing on web / mobile application development, data analysis pipelines, large data business intelligence 
            applications, and open source / enterprise data science tools and platforms. These experiences have given me a unique perspective 
            on a variety of programming languages and technology applications.
